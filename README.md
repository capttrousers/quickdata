# quickdata

## Tool to generate random data in csv form, built using node.js and vue.js.

### Skip to step 4 if you have git and node installed. The rest of the instructions are OS agnostic.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [Git](https://desktop.github.com/) for windows. For linux: `apt-get install git`
3. ** If on Windows, open the GitHub Desktop client and let it complete the Git installation, then open the Git Shell **
4. Make a directory for the project: `mkdir code` and move into the new folder: `cd ./code`
5. Clone project: `git clone https://github.com/capttrousers/quickdata.git`.
6. This will create a `quickdata` folder inside the `code` directory. Move into new project directory: `cd ./quickdata`.
7. Run `npm run build` to make sure you have the latest build of the front end code.
8. Run project: `node ./server.js` and navigate to `localhost:8080` in a browser to see the quick data tool.
